# YelpCamp

This is a full-stack node application built with the Express.js framework and MongoDB. It was the final project in 
[The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview). The application has
complete CRUD capabilities and RESTful routes.

To get the project up and running you will have to: 
1. Install and set up MongoDB on your machine.
2. Install Node.js
3. Use npm-install to install the required dependencies in the package.JSON file.
4. Run the app.js file.
5. Point your browser to localhost:3000

The application will seed the database with a few starter campgrounds. YelpCamp has full user authentication and authorization,
so in order to comment on any campgrounds, or add/edit/delete campgrounds you will need to set up an account.
